👋
Hey there! I’m **Imed Eddine Amara**, an Embedded Systems & IoT Engineering student from Tunisia, driven by curiosity, persistence, and a love for building things that matter. My journey is a blend of code, circuits, problem-solving, and the occasional “aha!” moment that keeps me hooked on engineering.

## 🎓 My Studies

I’m currently pursuing my degree in **Embedded Systems & IoT Engineering** at **ISIMG University**, Tunisia.   

Why does it matter to me?  
Because I believe the future belongs to connected, intelligent systems, and I want to be at the heart of designing and creating them. From microcontroller programming to PCB design, every course I take sharpens my ability to bring ideas to life.

## 💼 My Projects

Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects—some solo, some in agile teams—each leaving its own mark on my skills and mindset.

- **🚗 IoT Car App (2025)**  
  Worked in a 5-person Scrum team to design a complex IoT solution. Built the **UI in Flutter** and emulated the car using an **ESP32**. This project taught me the value of collaboration, adaptability, and maintaining clear communication in fast-moving environments.


Each project was more than just a task—it was a stepping stone toward becoming the engineer I aspire to be.

## 🌟 My Dreams

I’m not just chasing a career—I’m building a vision:  
- **Master Embedded Systems Engineering** and specialize in a field that merges **IoT, AI, and real-world applications**.  
- Develop innovative solutions that solve tangible problems, especially in automation, robotics, and smart environments.  
- Share my knowledge through open-source projects, technical writing, and mentorship.

## 🧠 My Story

Growing up in Tunisia, I was always the kid who **took things apart to see how they worked**—radios, toys, old computers. Sometimes I could fix them, sometimes I couldn’t, but I always learned something.  

The turning point came when I built my first working embedded project. Seeing my code control hardware in real-time was electrifying—it was the moment I knew this was my path.  

The journey hasn’t been without challenges. Tight deadlines, tricky bugs, and learning curves have tested my patience. But those obstacles shaped my resilience, my problem-solving mindset, and my belief that every bug has a fix—it just takes persistence to find it.
